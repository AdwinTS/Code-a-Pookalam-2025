# Pookalam Design - By Adwin T Sunil

🎉 **Happy Onam!** 🎉  
This project is a programmatic design of a beautiful **Pookalam (Floral Rangoli)** made using Python's `turtle` graphics module.

---

## 🌼 Project Overview

The design creates a vibrant Pookalam pattern using multiple shapes (circles, squares, hexagons, flowers) and a rich color palette, driven by mathematical functions and loops.  
Additionally, a custom text message is displayed on top of the design.

---

## ✅ Features

- Multiple concentric circles in different colors  
- Rotating squares and hexagons to create symmetry  
- Dynamic flower patterns using loops and trigonometry  
- Colorful, intricate design based on traditional Pookalam aesthetics  
- Custom message written on top of the design
